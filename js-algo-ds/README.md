Space complexity 

O(1)
O(n)
O(logn)

We would never have O(n*2) in space complexity unlike time complexity.

Time Complexity can be => O(1), O(logn), O(nlogn), O(n), O(n2) O(n3) 

Complexity of javascript Objects.

Add element - O(1)
Delete element - O(1)
Access element - O(1)
search element - O(n)
Object.keys - O(n)
Object.values - O(n)
Object.entries - O(n)

Time Complexity of javascript Arrays.

insert/delete at the end push/pop - O(1)
insert/delete at beginning - O(n)
Access by index -O(1)
Search - O(n)
shift/unshift/slice/concat/splice - O(n)
forEach/map/filter/reduce -O(n)
